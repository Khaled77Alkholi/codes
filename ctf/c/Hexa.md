# Hex Decryption little program

## Why did I make this tool?
I went to solve this challenge (https://ctflearn.com/challenge/115), which is an easy one that literally anyone can solve, and I wanted to use a decryption
tool that I make instead of going to an online decryptor.

### IT'S NOT FULLY  DONE YET!!
This is just a little program that receives the text from CLI as space-separated 2-bytes hex values and then decrypts the that text to ASCII text. 
Future changes:
1-I'll make it work with hex text even if it has no spaces. (for example:**6d696e656372616674**).
2-I'll also make it as a normal program, so that I can input values in the program instead of inputting values as CLI arguments.
